## TODO:

- [x] Figure out a way to retain data per user
  - We need a backend API with database
    - [ ] Or couldn't we use a file-based approach, skipping the need for a backend?
      - i.e. write JSON files on disk; IMO there will never be enough requests to overwhelm server's IO

- [ ] Establish list of commands and syntax
